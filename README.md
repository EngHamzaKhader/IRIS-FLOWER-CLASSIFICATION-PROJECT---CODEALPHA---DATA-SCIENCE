# IRIS-FLOWER-CLASSIFICATION-PROJECT---CODEALPHA---DATA-SCIENCE
I developed a machine learning model to classify Iris flower species using the Iris dataset. The project involved data exploration, preprocessing, and building a Random Forest classifier with hyperparameter tuning. The model achieved 93.33% cross-validation accuracy and 88.89% on the test set, demonstrating strong predictive capability and effective feature importance insights.
